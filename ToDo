Add unit test for user class

do I have name and user name backwards?
eg it doesnt matter if the un i taken but it does if their real name is taken


refactor!!

if theres time work out why in replying spec it has to be expect path to eq
/reply/2 and not /reply/1, i think some where theres a lingering peep, maybe
database didnt get properly cleaned


/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
spec refactoring

def add_peep content = 'test'
  post = Peep.create(content: content, time: Time.now)
end

replying_to_a_peep * extracting breaks this

def sign_in(email = 'test@test.com', password='12345')
  visit '/sessions/new'
  fill_in :email, with: email
  fill_in :password, with: password
  click_button 'log in'
end

replying_to_a_peep
