Add unit test for user class

maybe need a peep string to database text converter


do I have name and user name backwards?
eg it doesnt matter if the un i taken but it does if their real name is taken

Learn how to check css element with capy and or how to add css element to html
 need to put .class_name to find it with capybara/ or outside the page
 # is for the ID
 Id is unique in the page

refactor!!

if theres time work out why in replying spec it has to be expect path to eq
/reply/2 and not /reply/1, i think some where theres a lingering peep, maybe
database didnt get properly cleaned

spec refactoring

def add_peep content = 'test'
  post = Peep.create(content: content, time: Time.now)
end

replying_to_a_peep * extracting breaks this

def sign_in(email = 'test@test.com', password='12345')
  visit '/sessions/new'
  fill_in :email, with: email
  fill_in :password, with: password
  click_button 'log in'
end
